## How the Algorithm Works

### Step 1: Get Busy Times
```
User A: Busy 9-10 AM, 2-3 PM
User B: Busy 10-11 AM, 1-2 PM
User C: Busy 9-10 AM, 3-4 PM
```

### Step 2: Invert to Free Times
```
User A: Free 10 AM-2 PM, 3-5 PM
User B: Free 9-10 AM, 11 AM-1 PM, 2-5 PM
User C: Free 10 AM-3 PM, 4-5 PM
```

### Step 3: Find Intersection (Everyone Free)
```
Common Free Times:
- 10 AM - 1 PM
- 4 PM - 5 PM
```

### Step 4: Split into Meeting Slots
```
For 1-hour meeting:
- 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM âœ…
- 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM âœ…
- 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM âœ…
- 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM âœ…
- 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM âœ…
- 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM âœ…
```

### Step 5: Filter & Rank
- Remove weekend slots (if preference set)
- Remove slots outside work hours
- Rank by desirability
- Return top 10

## Technical Implementation

### Scheduling Algorithm (`lib/scheduling.ts`)

```typescript
findBestSlots(
  userIds,           // [yourId, friendId1, friendId2]
  calendars,         // [GoogleCalendarClient objects]
  windowStart,       // Date
  windowEnd,         // Date
  durationMin,       // 60
  preferences        // { workHoursStart, workHoursEnd, avoidWeekends }
) â†’ TimeSlot[]      // Top 10 best times
```

**Functions:**
- `invertBusyToFree()` - Converts busy periods to free periods
- `intersectFreeTimes()` - Finds when EVERYONE is free
- `splitIntoSlots()` - Splits into meeting-sized chunks
- `filterByPreferences()` - Applies time/day filters
- `rankSlots()` - Sorts by desirability

### API Route

```

Body: {
  friendUserIds: ["id1", "id2"],
  windowStart: "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z",

  durationMin: 60,
  preferences: {
    workHoursStart: "09:00",
    workHoursEnd: "17:00",
    avoidWeekends: true
  }
}

Response: {
  slots: [{start, end}, ...],
  participants: [{user details}],
  ...
}
```

### UI Component
